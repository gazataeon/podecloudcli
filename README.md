# PodeCloudCLI
Stable Pode container with CLIs for AWS, Azure and probably more later...



## Hello
Targets pode 1.0.1 : https://github.com/Badgerati/Pode

I use this for a dashboard to report on Cloud services, but you could probably use it for whatever you want. PROBABLY.

`docker pull gazataeon/podecloudcli:1.0.1`
`docker pull gazataeon/podecloudcli:1.0.1-alpine-3.10`
`docker pull gazataeon/podecloudcli:6.2.3-ubuntu-16.04`

or

`docker pull gazataeon/podecloudcli:latest` if you're feeling spicy 



## Multiple Versions!

Here you'll find two versions of the dockerfiles. The AlpineBased is around 300mb+ smaller and so far seems to work fine. 

Should you need a bit more compatibility then you can go for the UbuntuBased version!.
